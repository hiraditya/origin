## A module is...
##
## The list of EXPORTS is a list of files in the module directory without
## their corresponding extensions (e.g. foo bar baz). Each export defines
## three associated components: foo.hpp (the interface), foo.cpp (the
## implementation), and foo.test.cpp (a unit test). These files are required
## for every export.
##
## The list of IMPORTS gives the set of targets on which the module depends.
## Each imported module results in a physical dependency for the constructed
## binary.
##
## This defines a number of macros that are used to configure the build of
## the module, its test suite, and its documentation.
##
##    ORIGIN_CURRENT_MODULE         -- The current module name (all lower case)
