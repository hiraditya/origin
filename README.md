C++11 Libraries (Fork of https://code.google.com/p/origin/)


Origin is a collection of experimental libraries written using the C++11 programming language. The purpose of this
project is to foster experimentation with library design and programming techniques
 using the new version of the language.
The original project was hosted at https://code.google.com/p/origin/.
I wanted to add features to it so I moved it here.

The Origin libraries is designed around a minimal set of core facilities that wrap and extend the C++ standard library.
These facilities include an extensive type traits framework, support for concept-like type checking, new iterator
adaptors, ranges, and support for specification testing.

Getting started page: https://code.google.com/p/origin/wiki/GettingStarted
I'll move the getting started page soon.

Note: Origin is experimental and subject to frequent and often dramatic API changes. This project is not particularly
well-suited for production use. Also, C++11 is not broadly supported (Origin is only known to compile against GCC4.8).

Development discussion is hosted at Google Groups (https://groups.google.com/group/origin-dev). Currently, membership is
restricted and you must either be invited by an active member or request an invitation. This will probably change in the
future.
